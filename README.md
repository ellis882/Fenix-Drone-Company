## 1. UX

#### 1.1. Project Goals

The idea to come up with this project to make a website for drone services came because my partner is doing the certificates to become a drone pilot both in the Netherlands as in Brasil. At the moment this website is fiction but it could become real. With this project i hope to have a good base to build a custom made website in the future in different languages.

#### 1.2. User Stories

- As an owner of the company, I want to show what we already did and can do to gain more drone projects.
- As an owner of the company, I want to offer the possibility to give more information about the drone services we do.
- As an owner of the company, I want my website to be attractive and show the user that we are quilified to do specific drone  projects which requires expertise.

- As a user, I want to be able to get in touch with the company.
- As a user, I want to be able to check what they already did on projects and if they are quilified.

- As a person needing a drone service for a special field of expertise, I want to be able to see what the company already did and with what type of equipmemt they work for my project to become a succes.
- As a regular customer, I want to get in touch with the company.
- As a potential client, I would like to see what the company can do and already did on projects.

#### 1.3. Design

-	The fact content that is shown on the website (such as the certifications and projects, gallery page) proofs ability that the drone service will be done in a professional way and that gives the user a confident feeling to book the drone service.

-	The color brown that is used throughout the pages will give the user a feeling of trust, comfort and reliability which is important if you want to book a service. It gives a trusting feeling.

-	The image with zoom effect that is used on the about page is chosen because it looks as if the drone is flying towards the user. This is an interactive way of introducing the user with the company.

-	At the contact page, which is the last page, an image on the background with someone that controls a drone that flies away is chosen because it shows in the users mind that the contact form is sending to the company.

-	 The beginning and end images are especially chosen to give the user a signal of what the company represents. Goal is that the user is comfortable to book a drone service for a project with the company. Comfortable because the company is reliable, professional and good to work together with. The combination of colors and images that are used needs to come together to make a good users experience. The use of more images than text is chosen because good images says more than a lot of words and reach the emotional part of people. Which make them more willingly to ask more information or to book a drone service.

-	The simplicity of the website makes it easier for the user to find the information they want/need to know before booking a drone service.

    There are many variables at play. It's so locolized and so different based on the specific market in the different counrties in Europe and in Brasil, that it's hard to give a fixed price. A lot of things are considered in the price like; the level of expertise, the industry, the insurance coverage, travel surcharges (is a job out of the regular service area), pricing-per-acre (for the specific industry) instead of per-hour and market value and ROI (what problems does Fenix Drone Company solves and how much is that worth)

## 4. Testing 

### 4.1. Code Validators

-[HTML Validator About](http://workspace/fenix-drone-company/readme.files/html validator about.png)
No errors just had put &amp instead of &amp; that was solved right away

-[HTML Validator Projects](http://workspace/fenix-drone-company/readme.files/html validator projects.png)
No errors found
In my HTML i had add style at the images for "height:auto;width:100%;" to avoid error. 

-[HTML Validator Gallery](http://workspace/fenix-drone-company/readme.files/html validator gallery.png)
One warning about section lacks heading, but this was a design choice

-[HTML Validator Contact](http://workspace/fenix-drone-company/readme.files/html validator contact.png)
No errors found

-[CSS Validator](http://workspace/fenix-drone-company/readme.files/css validator.png)
No errors found

### Responsiveness

- To test the responsivness of the site i used [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and lighthouse on desktop [Lighthouse desktop](http://workspace/fenix-drone-company/readme.files/lighthouse desktop.png) and on mobile [Lighthouse mobile](http:/workspace/fenix-drone-company/readme.files/lighthouse mobile.png)



### Bugs

- One of the major bugs I found during the development process was to set the outline of my promo statistics section on the projects page. Could not outline them good. I had solve that by setting the width and margin property different.

- Another bug that i found was that the images of the projects section were to big and overflowing on smaller screens. Had solve that to make an scroll function when overflowing with the media queries.

## 6. Credits 

In the content section you can find all the sources were i got my information from. I had used a lot of google serach to get the information i needed for my website and to solve difficulties while making the website. 

### 6.1 Content 

- The text for the Expertise- and Projects section and a bit for the Certifications list was taken from the website of the [Dutch Drone Company] (https://www.dutchdronecompany.com/)

- For the certifications list, information was taken from the website [Drone Flight Academy] (https://www.droneflightacademy.eu/)

- Text for the drones we use was taken from a search on google to see which drones are used in the area's of expertise. Matching images where taken from [Unsplash, free images](https://unsplash.com/)

- Idea for Gallery page on how the images are set up and Landing Page zoom effect with overlay text was inspired by the Love Running Project at [Code Institute]

- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Contact page was taken from Code Institute in LMS [specific from the Love Running project](https://www.codeinstitute.net)

- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

- Idea of a promo statistics section was taken from [w3 Schools, specific from the templates files](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_startup.htm)

- Pricing is a tricky part because there are a lot of things to consider for making a price. Information to consider i took from [DroneLife](https://dronelife.com/2017/05/31/professional-operators-price-drone-services/)

### Media

- The photos/ Images used on the website are all taken from Unsplash, Free Images. Because the website is fiction i had no acces to video or real images. If the website was real i would use short video's of the projects that were done by the company and different images of the drones we use and gallery page. Now i had used images for the look and feel of the company.

- Videos for drone users i watched to get inspired [youtube](https://youtu.be/v0TeCv4eqyc) (https://youtu.be/i3V2L1XHZcA)
